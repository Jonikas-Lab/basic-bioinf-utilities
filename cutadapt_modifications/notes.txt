Modifying the cutadapt program (for more convenient use in experiments/mutant_pool_screens/preprocessing_and_alignment/code/deepseq_preprocessing_wrapper.py mostly). 

Note: it uses tabs for indent, not spaces! Careful about that.

TODO submit patches for that to the cutadapt site?  But it'll need tests and things, I suppose...  Also I think my cutadapt version isn't the newest one.

0) original program (cutadapt_original)

Copied from /usr/local/bin/cutadapt, in case I decide to replace that with my version later (probably a bad idea though)


1) Give cutadapt a --too-long-output option similar to the existing --too-short-output option, to save too-long reads to a file instead of discarding them.

Done (easy), that's cutadapt_mine1. 

Tested, works: 

    basic_work_mine/cutadapt_modifications >> cutadapt_mine1 -a CCCGG -e 0 -m 7 -M 9 --untrimmed extra1 --too-short extra2 --too-long extra3 test.fa
    >right_8bp
    AAAAAAAA
    basic_work_mine/cutadapt_modifications >> cat extra1
    >no_adapter
    AAAAAAAA
    basic_work_mine/cutadapt_modifications >> cat extra2 
    >too_short_5bp
    AAAAA
    basic_work_mine/cutadapt_modifications >> cat extra3 
    >too_long_10bp
    AAAAAAAAAA


2) Do something to make the untrimmed, too-long and too-short sequences all go into a single file instead of three different ones!  

Done (easy), that's cutadapt_mine2. 

In the original (or my v1), if you give the same filename to these three options, things get messy:

    basic_work_mine/cutadapt_modifications >> cutadapt_mine1 -a CCCGG -e 0 -m 7 -M 9 --untrimmed extra --too-short extra --too-long extra test.fa 
    >right_8bp
    AAAAAAAA
    basic_work_mine/cutadapt_modifications >> cat extra
    >too_short_5bp
    AAAAA
    AAAA

New version works:

    basic_work_mine/cutadapt_modifications >> cutadapt_mine2 -a CCCGG -e 0 -m 7 -M 9 --untrimmed extra --too-short extra --too-long extra test.fa
    >right_8bp
    AAAAAAAA
    basic_work_mine/cutadapt_modifications >> cat extra
    >no_adapter
    AAAAAAAA
    >too_short_5bp
    AAAAA
    >too_long_10bp
    AAAAAAAAAA
